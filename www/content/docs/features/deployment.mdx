description: Deploy to Vercel, Docker, or any Node.js host.
---

Every generated project includes a `vercel.json` config and can be deployed with Docker or any platform that runs Node.js.

## Vercel

The generated `vercel.json` is ready to go:

```json title="vercel.json"
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "dist/server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": { "maxDuration": 60, "memory": 1024 }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "dist/server.js",
      "methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Build the project

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    npm run build
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Deploy

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    npx vercel --prod
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Set your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard under **Settings > Environment Variables**. At minimum, set `NODE_ENV=production` and `DATABASE_URL` if you're using a database.

<Callout>
  Vercel's serverless functions are stateless. If you're using SQLite, you'll need to switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production since SQLite requires a persistent filesystem.
</Callout>

## Docker

If you enabled Docker during scaffolding, you already have a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. See the [Docker](/docs/features/docker) page for the full setup.

To deploy with Docker on any host:

```bash title="Terminal"
docker compose up --build -d
```

For production, make sure to:

- Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your `.env`
- Use strong passwords for your database
- Place a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) in front for TLS

The generated server handles `SIGTERM` gracefully, so Docker and Kubernetes can shut down containers without dropping in-flight requests.

## Railway

Railway auto-detects Node.js projects. Push your code and set the environment variables in the dashboard.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run build
```

Set the start command to `node dist/server.js` and add your environment variables (`NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`).

Railway provides managed PostgreSQL and MySQL databases that you can connect directly via `DATABASE_URL`.

## Any Node.js host

The generated project compiles to plain JavaScript. Any platform that runs Node.js 18+ works:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install and build

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    npm ci
    npm run build
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Start the server

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    NODE_ENV=production node dist/server.js
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The server listens on the port defined by `PORT` (defaults to 3000). Point your reverse proxy or load balancer at that port.

## Environment variables in production

At minimum, set these for any production deployment:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | Your host's expected port |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your production database connection string |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | Adjust based on expected traffic |

See the [Environment Variables](/docs/features/environment-variables) page for the full list.
