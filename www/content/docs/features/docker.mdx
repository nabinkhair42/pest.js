description: Dockerfile and docker-compose generation.

When Docker support is enabled, PEST.js generates three files.

## Dockerfile

Multi-stage build for small production images:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

When using **Prisma**, a `prisma generate` step is added to the build stage and the generated client is copied to the production stage.

## docker-compose.yml

Always includes an `app` service. When a database is selected (PostgreSQL or MySQL), a `db` service is added with health checks.

### PostgreSQL example

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U user -d mydb"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  db_data:
```

### SQLite

No `db` service is added since SQLite is file-based. Only the `app` service is generated.

## .dockerignore

```txt
node_modules
dist
.env
.git
coverage
*.log
.DS_Store
```

## Running

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
